# Cloud SOC | Azure Sentinel & Honeypot Project

A Cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) project demonstrating security monitoring and threat detection in Azure. The project involves deploying a Windows VM with exposed RDP as a honeypot, integrated with Azure Sentinel (SIEM) for log analysis.

Key Features:

- Windows VM with public RDP exposure to simulate common security misconfigurations
- Azure Sentinel integration for log ingestion and analysis
- Custom alert rules for monitoring successful and failed login attempts
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) implementation for automated deployment

The project showcases practical security monitoring, SIEM implementation, and infrastructure automation while providing hands-on experience with Azure security tools and services.
